<h1>Top 3 albums of 2022 thus far (in no particular order)</h1>
<section>
	<div>"The Kick" by Foxes</div>
	<p>It's so DANCEY and 80s. Bless yourselves with "Sister Ray," "Absolute," "Two Kinds of Silence," and her magnum opus "Sky Love." Thank you.</p>

	<div>"In Real Life" by Mandy Moore</div>
	<p>She has really found herself. Baby let herself play around with a synth or two on this album after going away from pop music following her 2001 album. Still as wise as ever. Listen to "In Other Words" and "Four Moons" to FEEL again.</p>

	<div>Harry's House" by Harry Styles</div>
	<p>His voice is wonderful. It simply is. His most pop album to date still has indie flair that I love. You must stream "Dayight," "Grapejuice," and "Keep Driving" if you need an example of good music.
